<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California, Los Angeles advised by [Prof. Achuta Kadambi](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/achuta-kadambi/). Previously, I obtained my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University in 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. John Wright](https://www.columbia.edu/~jw2966/). I received my B.E. in Electronic Information Engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2019. 

My research interests include computer vision, computational imaging and generative AI. Currently, I am focusing on 3D vision using both neural (implicit) and physical (explicit) representations. I am also actively collaborating with the groups of [Prof. Leonidas Guibas](https://geometry.stanford.edu/member/guibas/) at Stanford University and [Prof. Atlas Wang](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/atlas-wang) at University of Texas at Austin.

I joined <img src="images/Google_logo.png" alt="Google" style="height: 18px;"/> as a Student Researcher in Summer 2024.
